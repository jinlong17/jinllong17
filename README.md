### Hi there, I'm [Jinlong Li(李金龙 in Chinese)!](https://jinlong17.github.io/) 👋

I am a Ph.D. student at the [Cleveland Vision & AI Lab](https://grail.eecs.csuohio.edu/~h.yu/index.html) in [Celveland State University](https://www.csuohio.edu/).
<!-- Before joining UCLA, I was a senior deep learning engineer at [Mercedes-Benz R&D North America(MBRDNA)](https://mbrdna.com/) and 
a computer vision engineer at [OPPO R&D US](https://www.oppo.com/en/). I have several publications in CVPR/ECCV/WACV/CoRL/ICRA/IROS/TIV/Transportation PartC as first author in the past 2 years.
 -->

🔭 **Reseach-wise, I mainly focus on**:

- **Autonomous Driving** topics related to **Perception**, **Simulation**, and **Cooperative Driving Automation**
- **Computer Vision** topics related to **Vision Tranformer** and **Image Enhancement**


😄 **I am open to**:

- collaboration opportunities (anytime & anywhere & any type) and 
- research internships
